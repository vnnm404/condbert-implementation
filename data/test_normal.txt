خب ادامه صحبتامو در متن دوم عنوان خواهم کرد سريع بدون احوال پرسي چون در متن اول مباحثه مطرح کردن وارد اصل مطلب ميشم در مورد مسئله عقيده اي که متحدان اروپا در آمريکا براي علاقه نداشتن آمريکا به تحريم روسيه مطرح کردن با عقيده اي که مسئولين آمريکا دارن اين نامتوازني جزو مواردي است که بارها در موردش صحبت کردم و بدون دخالت در امور داخلي دولت آمريکا چون با عقيده صلح جهاني معتقد به عدم مداخله دولت ها جز در موارد اضطراري که واقعا دولتي نيازمند باشه در امور داخلشون در مورد انسجام اين دولت يک مقدار صحبت خواهم کرد و مسئله تجيزات جاسوسي ساخته شده توسط آمريکا مسئله بعدي که حتما در پيج اقاي اوباما مطرح  خواهم کرد از رسانه هاي ايران ميخوام تا زمان مطمئن نشدن از عملکرد آمريکا سوسه پردازي نکنن چون امريکا هنوز در قبال اين تجيزات صحبت خاصي نکرده و اما من در پيج اقاي اوباما مطرح خواهم کرد چون اگه اين سياستي در جهت کاهش اغتشاشات باشه و کاهش نابساماني اوضاع حاکم بر جهان و ممانعت از اهدف گروهک هاي تروريست و دولت هايي که در جهت خصومت براي بدتر شدن اوضاع نابسامان حاکم بر جهان باشه و جلوگيري از قدرت طلبي بعضي از دولت ها مثل روسيه و ايجاد يک رقابت سالم مي تونه روش درست آمريکا باشه اما به هر حال من مطرح خواهم کرد و مسئله ديگه واقعا من متعجبم چرا اين قدر دولت ها اقدام و تلاششون به ساخت تجيزات نظامي و جنگي بيشتره بحرين هم که حالا آزمايش سلاح ميکنه چرا يکم به جاي اين موارد نميگم اصلا توجه به تجهيزات نظامي نشه چرا يکم توجه به رفاه مردم نشه آخه همش جنگ همش جنگ انگار جنگ شده تنها دليل مسئولين چرا به جاي جنگ براي گسترش اراضي و لج و لج بازي سران دولت ها و قدرت طلبي يکم توجه به مسائل و مشکلات در همون حيطه اي که تسلط دارن نميشه چرا يکم مسئولين در جهت رفاه بشر کار نميکنند که اين قدر مسئله جنگ رو وسط ميکشند يعني واقعا مسئولين جنگ رو عامل پيشرفت مي دونند؟اگه مبتني بر اين عقيده باشن پس بايد احساس تاسف خورد به تمام مسئولين حرف من اينه اميد اينو دارم با پيشبرد مباحثات صلح نامه ايران و آمريکا ريشه جنگ برداشته بشه و تلاش مسئولين در جهت رفاه جامعه بشري و رقابت سالم باشه تا قدرت طلبي و لج و لج بازي و ياداوري خاطرات گذشته و تکيه بر اون با هدف پايبندي خصومت ها و تحريک کننده جنگ بين دولت ها
